# Spotify song list extractor from a play list

Have you ever wanted to get the complete song list from a spotify playlist?
The idea is to get the song name and author name and in the future be able to transform a spotify playlist to a youtube/deezer/soundclod/etc playlist.

This is a Wip but now given a spotify playlist id you can get the complete song list and also if you use windows open one random song in your default browser.
